## Chicago Blizzard Pt. 1, 1967 
This field recording is from the [Studs Terkel Radio Archive](https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/). Here, Studs Terkel walks around Chicago after a historic blizzard and asks Chicagoans about their reactions.

Click [here](https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/chicago-blizzard-field-recordings-january-1967-snow-part-2) to listen to the first 10min of this field recording. Stop listening at 10:47, when Studs goes to the supermarket. As you are listening, ask yourself:
- What is Studs role in the recording? How does he treat people? How do they treat him?
- What does Studs seem concerned with? What do the people in the recording seem concerned with?
- What sounds -- beyond voices -- do you hear?
- What are some particularly interesting moments on the tape? You may want to hit pause and note the time (e.g., "6:32 -- Studs makes a bad joke.")
